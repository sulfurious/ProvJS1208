# reveal.js

A CSS 3D slideshow tool for quickly creating good looking HTML presentations. Doesn't _rely_ on any external libraries but [highlight.js](http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/description/) is included by default for code highlighting.

Note that this requires a browser with support for CSS 3D transforms and ``classList``. If CSS 3D support is not detected, the presentation will degrade to less exciting 2D transitions. A [classList polyfill](http://purl.eligrey.com/github/classList.js/blob/master/classList.js) is incuded to make this work in < iOS 5, < Safari 5.1 and IE.
